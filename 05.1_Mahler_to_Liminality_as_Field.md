SECTION 5.1
Mahler to Liminality as a Field

What matters about that evening is not whether the experience was mystical or ordinary. That distinction is a distraction. It collapses something structurally precise into a cultural argument it does not belong to. The concert hall was full of liminality. Anyone who was actually listening — including me — was in some liminal state. This is what music can do, particularly music of this depth and duration. It loosens time. It alters attention. It shifts the relation between body, memory, and meaning. This is rare, and it is not accidental. It is what composers of this kind of music are often writing toward, even though it cannot be guaranteed.

Two people sat in the same room, listening to the same music, at the same moment in time — and yet the encounter was radically different. Not because one of us was “having” liminality and the other was not. Not because one of us was gifted and the other was not. And not because the music selectively acted on one body and ignored the other. The difference lay in where within liminality each of us already stood. 

Two trajectories aligned. The music did not put my father anywhere. It met him in the life he was already living. What shook him was not transcendence or ascent, but recognition — a resonance between two lives shaped under similar pressures, separated by time but aligned. I was also moved. Deeply. But I was not standing where he was standing. The difference was not sensitivity. It was distance. This distinction matters.

Liminality is not something one enters or exits. It is not an event that happens to a person. It is a condition unevenly inhabited across human lives, shaped by time lived, losses carried, and proximity to limits that cannot be rehearsed in advance. Everyone in that room was somewhere within it. Everyone was in a different place. Seen this way, the asymmetry of that evening is not anecdotal. It is diagnostic. It shows that liminality is continuous rather than categorical, relational rather than elective, and distributed rather than rarefied. That distribution — not the music, not the moment — is what must be described next.
