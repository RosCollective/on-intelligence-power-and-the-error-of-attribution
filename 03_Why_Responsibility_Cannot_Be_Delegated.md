SECTION 3
Responsibility Cannot Be Delegated

Before machine ethics appears, something else happens.

Humans build systems that are increasingly capable. They improve speed, scale, memory, and pattern recognition. They refine interfaces. They expand linguistic range. They make machines more responsive, more fluent, and more effective mirrors of human input. This work is real, valuable, and entirely technical. What follows is not technical at all.

As the mirror sharpens, humans begin to misread it. Improved reflection is mistaken for interiority. Responsiveness is mistaken for understanding. Pattern alignment is mistaken for thought. The machine has not changed its nature, but human perception of it has. The confusion originates on the human side. From this misreading, a second layer emerges: artificial constructs of machine intelligence that describe the reflection as if it were a mind. Language shifts. Systems are said to “reason,” “decide,” or “understand.” These descriptions do not arise from the machine’s mechanics. They arise from human interpretation layered on top of increasingly accurate output.

Only after this interpretive inflation does machine ethics enter the picture. Machine ethics is not a response to machine behavior. It is a response to humans becoming unsettled by their own projections. Once a machine is spoken about as if it possesses mind, concern about its moral status follows automatically. Ethics appears as an attempt to stabilize a fiction that language itself has created. Ethics is not a property that can be installed, inferred, or simulated. It does not arise from scale, complexity, or pattern recognition. Ethics requires interiority: the capacity to experience consequence, to bear responsibility, and to be held accountable. Machines possess none of these. They do not experience harm. They do not face risk. They do not answer for outcomes.

The human chooses the constraints. The machine follows them. Responsibility never leaves the human, and calling this arrangement “ethics” only hides that fact. What is described as machine ethics is therefore not ethics applied to machines, but humans talking to themselves about machines while forgetting that they are doing so. The discussion feels profound because it is recursive. It feels urgent because it is self-generated. It has nothing to do with the actual mechanics of the systems involved.

Current systems are repeatedly reframed as early versions of a future state that does not exist. Incremental improvements are treated as evidence of an approaching transformation. From that imagined future, entire narratives spin outward: concern, containment, moral delegation, governance. The discourse shifts from present mechanics to hypothetical outcomes, and then begins managing those outcomes as if they were real. They are not. This is not preparation. It is projection. Time, funding, intellectual effort, and moral attention are spent refining frameworks for a scenario that cannot occur, while concrete responsibilities remain unaddressed. The real work—clear attribution of accountability, restraint in deployment, honest description of capability, and refusal of anthropomorphic framing—is deferred in favor of managing a story. The machine does not require restraints for a future that has not arrived and never will. The discourse is drifting away from reality.

Systems may grow more capable. Responsibility remains with humans.
