# On Intelligence, Power, and the Error of Attribution
## On Misrecognition and Restraint

*On Intelligence, Power, and the Error of Attribution: On Misrecognition and Restraint* is a theoretical and critical work examining how intelligence, agency, and responsibility are routinely misattributed to technical systems on the basis of power, scale, and effect. The paper argues that contemporary accounts of artificial intelligence increasingly treat domination, speed, and harm as evidence of cognition, while displacing responsibility away from the human actors who design, deploy, and profit from such systems.

The work does not propose new ethical frameworks, technical solutions, or definitions of intelligence. Instead, it traces how a human projection—the attribution of human reasoning and agency to machines—stabilizes through language, abstraction, and market reward, and how this projection functions as a practical fiction that obscures accountability.

This paper is not a warning about future machines. It is an analysis of present practice and a refusal of misplaced restraint.

## Audience

This work is intended for readers with backgrounds in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, philosophy of technology, ethics, systems theory, or adjacent fields who are comfortable with sustained conceptual argument and critical analysis. It assumes familiarity with contemporary discourse around AI, automation, and intelligence, and does not provide introductory overviews, primers, or explanatory glosses for general audiences.

## How to Read This Paper

This is not a tutorial, manifesto, or policy proposal. It is a sustained argumentative work that proceeds by refusal rather than construction.

The early sections establish why intelligence, agency, and ethical responsibility cannot be meaningfully delegated to machines. Section 5 introduces liminality as a human field phenomenon and marks a shift in mode that later sections depend upon. The argument thereafter narrows rather than expands, closing off common escape routes such as renaming, ethical substitution, or speculative futures.

The appendices are not illustrative. They document historical, philosophical, scientific, and embodied human material that bears the costs of misattribution discussed in the main text. While they may be approached selectively, they are necessary for understanding what is at stake.

This work is best read with time and attention. It is not designed for extraction, summary, or modular reuse.
