SECTION 5.5
Liminality, Artifacts, and the Error of Misnaming

Liminality does not announce itself directly. It leaves evidence. That evidence takes the form of artifacts or work products. When a human being remains present within liminal conditions long enough — whether slowly or under pressure — something may come into existence that did not exist before. A new piece of music. A mathematical proof. An advanced method. An original text. A novel structure. A political decision that alters a trajectory. These are not accidents, and they are not decorations. They are the residue of liminality. Artifacts are not cognition itself. They are what remains after attention, judgment, memory, and effort have been compressed into a form that can persist beyond the moment of its making. This is how we know meaningful work occurred. No access to interior experience is required. No testimony about feelings or states is necessary. The artifact carries the trace of time spent, choices made, and constraints navigated. It encodes duration without narrating it. It is unique.

Artifacts as work products do not appear because liminality was entered. They appear because someone stayed with uncertainty long enough for it to organize. They stayed with difficulty long enough for structure to emerge. This staying is costly to human beings. It consumes time, taxes attention and often feels inefficient, circular, or unproductive. Many people abandon the work at precisely this point, not because they lack intelligence, but because the cost has become visible and tiresome.

Those who patiently remain, those who continue even when continuing seems futile, often report a breakthrough that does not feel like effort at all. The work just arrives. Not as a plan, a sequence of steps, or something consciously summoned or directed. The visitation is unexpected, abrupt, fully formed, and frequently misaligned with what the person thought they were working toward. It can feel intrusive, interruptive, even disorienting — less like producing something and more like being met by it. This experience has been described, across centuries, as inspiration or the presence of a muse. Coleridge did not experience Kubla Khan as the product of deliberate construction. De Quincey wrote of thoughts that seemed to think themselves, arriving with a force and clarity that exceeded conscious intention. They are reports of surprise. What matters is not whether this language is literal or figurative. What matters is that it names a real and recurring human experience: the sense that something has appeared that one did not know how to make, and could not have predicted in advance. The work came from somewhere, but did not arrive by conscious direction. The human did not abdicate agency. They were available to encounter something that could not be forced. Availability is not the same as control. Reparation is not the same as command.

Once brought into being, an artifact can extend meaning beyond the limits of the moment in which it was formed. It can continue a line of thought after the person who produced it has stepped away. It can reveal relationships that were not consciously articulated at the time of its making. Einstein’s equations did not merely record his thinking; they disclosed consequences he did not live to see worked out. Mozart’s music did not only express emotion; it organized sound in ways that had not previously existed and that continue to this day to generate meaning. Woolf’s forms did not simply tell stories; they altered what narrative itself could do.

In these cases, the artifact does not repeat what was already known. It becomes something new. This novelty arises because meaning has been compressed into a form capable of interaction — with other minds, other contexts, other moments in time. The human encounter with liminality produces the artifact. The artifact then becomes a new condition of encounter for others. 

What is happening now with machine tools does not require awe. It requires description. Liminality is occurring. It has always occurred. What is new is the rate at which people are encountering it and the speed at which they are able to move while within it. Machines do increase speed and they can reduce friction while expanding reach. They do not, however, supply agency. What they make possible is that human beings can remain within liminal conditions while moving faster and further than before. This increases the number of original artifacts or work products produced and compresses the time in which they appear. This is what observers are noticing. Because tools are present at the moment artifacts become visible, it becomes tempting to imagine that cognition itself has become shared or hybrid.

This temptation flatters us. It allows us to admire our reflection instead of observing the conditions. But nothing truly new has come alive. The work still is effortful. The uncertainty still belongs to humans. The judgment still happens somewhere. Calling this “hybrid cognition” mistakes acceleration for authorship. It treats tools as agents and humans as conduits. It explains novelty without accounting for presence. Science has long been unwilling to name liminality directly, dismissing it as too subjective, too mystical, too “woo.” Science has treated liminality as if it were a cobra term, effectively beating it with the not scientifically verifiable stick until dead or reducing it to flow terminology. Yet it shows little hesitation in embracing speculative narratives about hybrid or emergent cognition — narratives with no historical record, no phenomenology, and no lived account of what it is supposed to feel like.

This is an inversion.

We have millennia of human history describing liminal experience across art, science, mathematics, philosophy, and craft. We have consistent reports of inspiration, uncertainty, non-linear discovery, and surprise. We have no such history of hybrid cognition. Calling liminality “too woo” while advancing hybrid cognition as sober explanation does not reduce mystification. It replaces a historically attested human phenomenon with a technically dressed fiction.
