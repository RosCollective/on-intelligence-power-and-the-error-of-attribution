SECTION 5
Limits of Attention and the Shape of Meaning

Appendices A through F are not optional context. They are a prerequisite for reading what follows. The figures and lineages documented here mark the historical cost of occupying liminal positions: epistemic, embodied, political, and often lethal. If you do not have the attention to read them, or the capacity to witness what they record without instrumentalizing it, the remainder of this paper will not be intelligible. This is not a failure of comprehension but of posture. In that case, you should not proceed.

When my father was very very old, in his 90s, we sat together in an iconic concert hall listening to Mahler’s 9th being performed by some of the world’s best musicians of the day. This was before my father lost his mooring in the contemporary flow of time and drifted off into a space where today or the hour on the clock or when lunch was happening lost their grip. Until he died at 98 he remained at heart his bright, warm, intelligent self, though increasingly uncertain. I was probably one of his favorite people as he was mine. When we would meet he would open his arms enthusiastically to enfold me close. On this particular evening my father was entirely present. He knew Mahler’s 9th well. He had a history of being taken along (from very young childhood until well into his teens) to orchestral rehearsals. His mother was in the violin section in his hometown orchestra so he heard before he could name them entire classical repertoires.  He would be napping or reading or playing or doing homework while music infused the air. In later life classical music was the constant background to his work or reflection. When he read the news of his mother’s death in a much delayed family letter he went alone into a room, listened to Mozart, and wept. That concert evening I was hearing Mahler’s 9th for the first time in my life. For my father this was maybe the 5th or 6th time.  

The current Wikipedia entry on Mahler’s 9th does a serviceable job summarizing the musical themes of movements of the symphony concluding: "The last note is marked ersterbend ("dying away"). The last two pages last for six minutes, an unprecedented amount of time for so few notes. Leonard Bernstein speculated at the end of his fifth Norton lecture that the entire movement is symbolically prophesying three kinds of death: Mahler’s own impending death, the death of tonality, and the death of "Faustian" culture in all the arts."  The 9th is seen as Mahler’s farewell to the world which includes his experience of the death of his beloved daughter Maria Anna.

My father and I were holding hands through the final movement and when it fell into silence, while the crowd around us was getting up, putting on coats, talking, laughing, leaving, moving, my father sat vibrating and shaken to his core.  My father was so profoundly moved he simply could not organize his body. I just quietly waited for him. For me the music was grand, imposing, complex, lush, powerful. For him standing on the edge of his own mortality given his entire informed well-lived long human life it was beyond other. Mahler was in a liminal state while he was composing this symphony yet still also living his life.  My father was in a liminal state when he was hearing this symphony while also still living his life.
