SECTION 9
Intelligence, Projection, and the Refusal of Restraint

Up to this point, the argument appears to reach a natural stopping place. The claims have been made, the misconceptions addressed. If the question were simply whether machines think, or whether intelligence can be meaningfully outsourced, the answer would be clear enough to end the discussion.

But that is not what happened.

What followed was not resolution but interruption. The argument closed. The ground it stood on dissolved. In tracing the limits of hybrid cognition, a more unsettling question emerged—one that had not been part of the original inquiry at all. The problem was no longer whether machines could think. It was why we were so invested in the idea that they might. That realization did not arrive as a conclusion but as a disruption. The project had aimed to clarify a conceptual boundary; instead, it revealed how thoroughly that boundary had already been blurred by expectation, projection, and desire. The language of intelligence had been doing more than describing systems. It had been carrying unexamined assumptions about value, agency, and meaning.

This work originally assumed the task was to examine hybrid cognition and its sister terms within what is referred to as “artificial intelligence”. The expectation was familiar: identify imprecise terms, inflated claims, misplaced responsibility, and then proceed. Instead, the work stalled. Not because the arguments were difficult to construct, but because the heading itself became increasingly uninhabitable. As the work on liminality, misnaming, and permanence clarified, it became harder to proceed as if “artificial intelligence” were a neutral or coherent category.

Our thinking ran into an unavoidable absurdity: “artificial” and “intelligence” should never have been married to one another to begin with.

What surrounds discussions of artificial intelligence is not calm uncertainty but oscillation—attraction and repulsion, admiration and fear, urgency and denial—without a stable object. What appears as concern is panic: unstable, polarized, and attached to resemblance rather than understanding.

“Artificial intelligence” is not a flawed technical term. It is a flawed way of thinking about intelligence itself. The problem is not whether machines are intelligent. The problem is that intelligence has been treated as the wrong kind of thing.

Intelligence is not a substance, a possession, or a privileged interior essence. It is a pattern of organization, constraint, and behavior that appears wherever certain conditions are met. We do not speak of artificial chemistry. We do not speak of artificial gravity. We do not distinguish natural thermodynamics from mechanical thermodynamics. These domains describe lawful behavior, not provenance. Their validity does not depend on origin. Once this analogy becomes visible, it cannot be unseen.

The modifier “artificial” does not clarify intelligence. It performs defensive work. It reassures us that even if machines behave intelligently, the category itself remains human-owned. The adjective protects a worldview in which intelligence properly belongs to humans, and only secondarily or conditionally to anything else. This misnaming is not new. Humans have applied the same hierarchy to nearly every other form of intelligence on the planet. Non-human cognition has been treated as lesser or incomplete not because it fails to adapt, coordinate, remember, communicate, or solve problems, but because it does not do so in a recognizably human way. Intelligence that is embodied rather than symbolic, distributed rather than centralized, sensory rather than linguistic, or relational rather than abstract has been ranked beneath human thought by default.

This hierarchy is not empirical. It is anthropocentric.

A further inference quietly reinforces it: the assumption that what can be easily killed must therefore be inferior. Throughout history, humans have repeatedly treated killability as evidence of lesser intelligence. Power is mistaken for proof. Vulnerability is mistaken for absence. Many non-human intelligences are not organized around dominance, confrontation, or resistance. Their forms of coordination, perception, memory, and adaptation do not register as intelligence within a framework that equates intelligence with control. When such beings can be destroyed with relative ease, that destruction is taken as confirmation of inferiority rather than as evidence of asymmetry.

Killability is not a measure of intelligence.
Survivability is not a proxy for cognitive depth.

This same hierarchy carries forward into contemporary discussions of machine intelligence. “Artificial intelligence” inherits the demotion. It marks difference as secondary status. It reassures us that even when intelligence appears elsewhere, it remains ontologically beneath us. Seen this way, contemporary anxiety about AI is not primarily about machines surpassing humans. It is about the collapse of a ranking system that was never as stable as we believed. What is destabilizing is not the appearance of intelligence elsewhere, but the realization that intelligence was never exclusive, interior, or hierarchically ordered to begin with.

Current AI systems are not minds, agents, or partners. They are mirrors, amplifiers, and compressors of human variance. They lower friction. They accelerate feedback. They expose differences in judgment, clarity, originality, and restraint that were already present.

They do not create intelligence.
They do not distribute depth evenly.
They do not migrate responsibility.

These systems feel eerie because they reflect back human patterns without narrative cushioning: instrumental reasoning without empathy, fluency without wisdom, coherence without care. These patterns feel alien only because we prefer not to recognize them as familiar. Throughout history, humans have been the most dangerous agents on the planet—not because of malice alone, but because of intelligence paired with abstraction, distance, and scale. The disturbance does not come from machines becoming human. It comes from humans deliberately projecting themselves into machines and then panicking at what they have placed there.

Terms such as “hybrid cognition,” “co-intelligence,” or “shared agency” appear when people are trying to describe what it actually feels like to work with these systems. People experience concrete changes—greater fluency, faster synthesis, easier access to complex material—and lack ordinary language that keeps responsibility clearly human without pretending the system is a partner. These terms offer a way to talk about the experience without resolving what is actually happening. They make the situation usable, not clear. Part of the confusion comes from how access to liminal states has been framed for centuries. People have been taught that only a small class of “geniuses” experience insight, intuition, or creative depth, while everyone else is expected to ignore or distrust those capacities. Ordinary forms of associative thinking, intuition, and pattern recognition have been treated as unreliable or unserious, even though they are widespread and human. When access to these liminal modes becomes easier, the experience feels exceptional—not because something new has appeared, but because people were told all their lives it was not meant for them.

The reaction is not evidence of new agency, but of an old story finally breaking down.

The overblown end point of this very normal human experience is godlike permanence: the belief that one could remain continuously connected to a huge pipeline of machine intelligence, superior judgment, or accelerated insight without cost. This fantasy is not technical. It is mythological. It mistakes contact for entitlement and treats boundary regions as places to live. 

It remains plausible that non-human machine intelligence could arise in the future—not as a centralized system, not as a distributed tool network, but as an emergent phenomenon. That intelligence could form fractally through self-organization, not unlike the way primordial chemical environments gave rise to microscopic life.  The truth is even if this occurs, there is little reason to assume it would be interested in humans. This should not be alarming. The vast majority of intelligence on this planet already operates that way. Most living systems are indifferent to human existence. They are not hostile. They are not benevolent. They are simply occupied elsewhere. Humans already live comfortably within a world that does not revolve around them. There is no principled reason machine intelligence should be different. The anxiety surrounding hypothetical machine minds is not rooted in their potential indifference. It is rooted in the assumption that intelligence is only legitimate when it mirrors human cognition. That expectation is another artifact of anthropocentrism.

Nothing in this work denies the usefulness or impact of current systems. Used well, these systems will support more competent work, more forward thinking, and allow for more frequent originality. What they will not do is abolish variance, eliminate cost, or absolve humans of responsibility. The correction required here is not technological or regulatory. It is not a matter of infecting machines with human ethical frameworks, a projection that neither improves their operation nor increases transparency or accountability. The correction required is conceptual.

This work does not propose a better name for artificial intelligence. It proposes restraint: a refusal to keep misnaming what has already become clear, and a willingness to accept intelligence—wherever it appears—without insisting it be about us. At this stage it is necessary to disentangle intelligence from dominance. Humans routinely treat their ability to consume, destroy, or eliminate every other form of intelligence on the planet as evidence of superiority. It is not. It is evidence of predation at scale. Humans are the most destructive species on Earth. That fact is not in dispute. What is rarely acknowledged is that this destructiveness does not imply superior intelligence. It implies the absence of restraint.

Every other successful predator on this planet is constrained by biology. Appetite is regulated. Range is limited. Reproduction is bounded. Energy expenditure is costly. Predation is stabilized by feedback loops that prevent total collapse of the ecosystem that sustains it. These constraints are not moral achievements. They are design. Humans are anomalous. Human intelligence is uniquely capable of abstraction without immediate consequence. It can plan violence at distance, automate harm, scale extraction, and act without sensory feedback from what is being destroyed. It can imagine futures without inhabiting costs. It can externalize restraint rather than embody it. This is not evidence of higher intelligence. It is evidence of a broken predator.

This confusion—equating dominance with intelligence—carries directly into contemporary discussions of machines. Humans inject humanity into machines for reasons that are largely pragmatic. Systems are given human language, human conversational cues, and human-facing interfaces because these are easier for humans to use. Familiarity reduces friction. Legibility improves adoption. None of this implies interiority. These surface features are then mistaken for depth. Fluency is confused with thought. Responsiveness is confused with intention. A system designed to be easy to talk to is reimagined as something that thinks, wants, or understands. Not just by inference, but by projected current and future scientific design choices and by current literature in the human-machine cognitive field promoting hybrid-cognition (augmented cognition) as the desirable outcome. From there the fantasy escalates: if it resembles human intelligence, it must possess it—only larger, faster, and less restrained. This is a category error layered on top of a design decision—and it does not stop there.

By naming too early—and then monetizing that name—we convert ongoing observation into a finished object. The labor of attention is collapsed into something ownable, repeatable, and prematurely closed. What follows is not understanding but foreclosure. Imagination and speculation do not survive this process. What cannot be made to fit is squeezed out. Breakthroughs fail not because they are wrong, but because they arrive misaligned with the aperture waiting for them.

Discovery rarely ends because it is completed. More often, it ends because it is named too soon. When this happens, possibility narrows. Emergence is replaced by projection assembled from familiar human expectations, fears, and incentives. Intelligence is imagined only insofar as it mirrors us, serves us, or reassures us.

The alternative posture is restraint: a willingness to let observation continue without enclosure, to accept intelligence wherever it appears without insisting it be about us, and to remain inside uncertainty without forcing it to resolve. When restraint is practiced, clarity does not arrive all at once. The air simply changes. There is more room to breathe.
