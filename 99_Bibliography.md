On the Bibliography

The works cited here are not assembled to establish a lineage, demonstrate consensus, or authorize the claims of this paper. They appear as points of contact: moments where attention, discovery, or restraint became visible under different constraints. Some are included as phenomenological witnesses, others as historical precedents, and some as contrast cases. Inclusion does not imply agreement. Omission is not an error. The list reflects posture rather than territory.

Charles Darwin (1859)
On the Origin of Species.
(Read here not for its conclusions, but as an extended practice of sustained ecological attention in which observer, environment, and phenomenon are inseparable.)

Henri Poincaré (1908)
Science and Method.
(Especially chapters on mathematical invention and discovery. First-person account of non-linear insight, surprise, and the arrival of form prior to formal justification.)

Virginia Woolf (1939)
A Sketch of the Past.
(Posthumous essays describing “moments of being” and the emergence of form from perceptual rupture.)

Michael Polanyi (1958)
Personal Knowledge: Towards a Post-Critical Philosophy.
(Foundational articulation of tacit knowing; establishes that discovery and judgment precede formal articulation and cannot be fully externalized.)

Hannah Arendt (1958)
The Human Condition.
(Responsibility, action, and the irreducibility of human judgment.)

J. C. R. Licklider (1960)
Man-Computer Symbiosis.
(Historical framing of human–machine cooperation explicitly grounded in human agency.)

Douglas C. Engelbart (1962)
Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework.
(Early articulation of speed, reach, and friction reduction without claims of shared cognition.)

Jane Goodall (1971)
In the Shadow of Man.
(A record of proximity, duration, and disciplined attention that refuses exteriority without collapsing into projection; observation practiced from within the ecology studied.)

Edwin Hutchins (1995)
Cognition in the Wild.
(Distributed cognition in socio-technical systems; describes coordination without implying hybrid minds.)

Andy Clark (2003)
Natural-Born Cyborgs.
(Extended cognition via tools and environments; useful for clarifying extension without agency.)

Andy Clark (2008)
Supersizing the Mind.
(Philosophical account of cognitive extension frequently misread as hybrid cognition.)

Daniel Kahneman (2011)
Thinking, Fast and Slow.
(Frequently cited model of dual-process cognition; included as a contrast case rather than an explanatory account of discovery.)

Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi & Jeanne Nakamura (2014)
The Dynamics of Intrinsic Motivation and Flow.
(Addresses sustained engagement but does not account for liminal cost, breakdown, or artifact formation.)

Selected human–AI co-creation and HCI literature (2018–present; observational)
(Included as observational accounts of accelerated human cognition under reduced friction; not evidence of hybrid cognition or shared agency.)

Notes on Use

Inclusion does not imply agreement.
The bibliography functions as cartography rather than canon.
