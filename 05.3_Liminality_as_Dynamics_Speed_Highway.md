SECTION 5.3
Liminality as Dynamics: Speed, Training, and Risk

Think of human liminality not as a doorway or a rare threshold, but as a vast highway system with many, many lanes.

It begins at sidewalk speed. Literally. The place where you teach a child how to walk without falling, how to ride a tricycle, how to wobble and recover, how to stop. This is liminality at its slowest: learning balance, learning judgment, learning that bodies have limits and that limits matter. Nothing about this is trivial. Everyone starts here. No one skips it. As you move out from the sidewalk, the lanes widen. Bicycles. Residential streets. Familiar routes driven again and again. Speeds increase, but slowly. Errors are still forgiving. You can stall the engine. You can miss a turn. You can brake late and scare yourself without killing anyone. Recovery is built into the system.

Most human life happens here. Most human thinking happens here. Further along, the highway opens up. More lanes. Higher speeds. Fewer guardrails. The system assumes a driver who knows their vehicle, understands fatigue, knows when to slow down, knows when to pull over. This is where competence begins to matter in a serious way. This is where danger starts to appear — not because of speed itself, but because of mismanagement. The dangerous drivers are not necessarily the fast ones. Often they are the ones in the lower or middle lanes who misunderstand their own limits. The tired driver who insists they’re fine. The confident driver who believes skill compensates for exhaustion. The person who has always driven well and therefore assumes they can text, scroll, adjust navigation, and still stay in their lane.

They are wrong. The road does not care about their self-assessment. Some assume that automation will save them. That a driverless feature will correct a lapse in attention. That the system will compensate for hunger, lack of sleep, cognitive overload. Sometimes it does. Sometimes it doesn’t. Mechanical systems fail. Sensors misread. Edge cases happen. When that occurs at speed, the outcome is not philosophical.

There are bodies on this road. Traffic drops. Training becomes visible. At the extreme upper end — something closer to Formula One speeds — no one is there by accident. These drivers have trained for years. They have teams. Engineers. Spotters. Entire infrastructures designed to keep them alive at velocities the rest of the population should never attempt.

And still, people die. Not because cars are evil. Not because speed is immoral. But because human bodies, attention, and judgment remain finite. A moment of casualness. A fraction of a second of distraction. A misread signal. Fatigue ignored. Confidence outrunning capacity. The highway always contains risk. What changes is how expensive mistakes become.

This is what liminality looks like at scale. One system. Many lanes. Different speeds. Different tolerances. The same biological constraints everywhere. There is no lane shaming here. Driving slowly is not failure. Driving fast is not virtue. The only real danger is not knowing which lane you are actually capable of driving in — and refusing to act accordingly.

At the far edges of this highway, the lanes narrow again. The margin for error collapses. What was once recoverable becomes irreversible. Even among those who are trained, supported, and disciplined, outcomes diverge. Some people go to these outer limits and return. Some do not. This is not a failure of planning. It is not something better tooling will eliminate. It is the consequence of human bodies and minds operating at the edge of what they can sustain. The cost of working there is real. It is paid in time, health, relationships, stability, and sometimes life itself. That price is not evenly distributed, and it is not always visible in advance. No amount of intelligence, preparation, or good intention guarantees safe passage.

This is why extreme liminality has never been a reasonable goal for most people. Very few are willing to live at that intensity for long periods. Fewer still are willing to bear the discipline it requires: the monotony, the isolation, the constant self-monitoring, the refusal of distraction, the acceptance that one mistake may not be survivable. That reluctance is not a lack. It is judgment. Those who do this work are not heroes. They are specialists operating under severe constraints, supported by others who absorb much of the load so that the work can happen at all. When they return intact, it is not because the work was safe. It is because enough conditions aligned for long enough.

When they do not return intact, it is not because they were careless or unworthy. It is because the limits were real. This reality does not change when new tools appear. Tools can reduce friction. They can improve navigation and extend endurance at the margins. What they cannot do is remove the biological cost of sustained work at extreme velocity. That part of the equation remains human.
